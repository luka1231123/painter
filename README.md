# painter
so this is a program that allows you to paint pixelated images with different colours.

it allows to paint a 32 by 32 screen and it allows you to save it to a file


I first started working on a topDown game and wanted to paint the sprites
I decided to make a program that would help me do that. 
I coded this program with the same engine, i made this engine with sfml in 2022 and it's pretty cool
I just used sfml to render pixels and refresh the screen everything else is done in house.

to run this you will need dotnet and libsfml.
