# painter
so this is a program that allows you to paint pixelate images with different colours. 
I first started working on a topDown game and wanted to paint the sprites
I decided to make a program that would help me do that. 
I coded this program with the same engine, i made this engine with sfml in 2022 and it's pretty cool
I just used sfml to render pixels and refresh the screen everything else is done in house.

do run this you will need dotnet and libsfml.
